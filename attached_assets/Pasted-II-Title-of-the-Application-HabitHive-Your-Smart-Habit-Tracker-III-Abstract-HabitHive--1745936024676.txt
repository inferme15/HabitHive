II. Title of the Application
HabitHive – “Your Smart Habit Tracker”


III. Abstract 
HabitHive is a mobile application designed to help users track their physical exercise and engage in a community-driven fitness experience. Developed using Android Studio with Kotlin, the app allows users to log their workouts, monitor progress, and earn points based on their activities. These points can be compared with others in the community, fostering motivation and healthy competition. The application provides an intuitive user interface for logging exercise routines, viewing personal achievements, and accessing leaderboards. By integrating habit-building principles with gamification, Habithive encourages users to maintain consistency in their fitness journey.


IV.  Existing System
Google Fit – Tracks various physical activities and provides health insights but lacks a community leaderboard for competition.
MyFitnessPal – Focuses on calorie tracking and workouts but does not emphasize a point-based reward system for motivation.
Nike Training Club – Offers workout routines and professional guidance but lacks a habit-building approach with community comparisons.
Strava – Ideal for runners and cyclists, providing leaderboards, but does not support diverse workout types.
Habitica – Gamifies habit-building but is not specialized for fitness tracking.


V. Proposed System 
      The proposed system includes as follows:
Gamified Point System – Users earn points based on exercise completion, which can be compared with the community leaderboard.
Community Goal Sharing – Users can set goals and share them with the community for motivation and accountability.
Personalized Profile & Interests – Users can input their hobbies and fitness interests to receive tailored suggestions.
Interactive Leaderboard – Dynamic rankings based on points scored, encouraging friendly competition.
Push Notifications & Reminders – Customizable notifications to remind users of their daily exercise goals.
Seamless Firebase Integration – Real-time syncing of user progress, leaderboard updates, and community engagement.
