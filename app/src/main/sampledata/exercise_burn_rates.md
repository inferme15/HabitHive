## How Calculations Work

1. **Calorie Calculation**: 
   - Formula: `Burn Rate ร Duration (in minutes)`
   - Example: Running (10 cal/min) for 30 minutes = 300 calories burned

2. **Points Calculation**:
   - Formula: `Calories รท 10`
   - Example: 300 calories = 30 points

## Notes

- These burn rates are approximations based on average intensity.
- Actual calorie burn varies based on individual factors such as weight, fitness level, and intensity.
- The "Other" category uses a default medium intensity burn rate.
